# Gym Diary

**1 Feb 26:** First day back in the gym since moving to Dundee. Did some upper body lifts, nothing too crazy - it's been a while. Didn't eat enough, had the low blood sugar shakes. Was nice to swim again though. Was nice to do it on a Sunday; unrushed.

**2 Feb 26:** First time going to the club before work. Up at 6, in the pool for 7. Didn't use the gym, I'm easing myself into it all again slowly + dwimming at 7am was enough to make me feel quezy driving home anyway.
